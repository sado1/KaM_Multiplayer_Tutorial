# KaM Remake Multiplayer Tutorial
How to play KaM Remake in multiplayer mode

# before you start
- use map editor, to check location which you will play
- figure out, where are all resources, and plan your first few minutes of the game. keep in mind:
  - try to make small base
  - do not make long roads, especially in the beginning. And if you really have to, build something (ie. farms) along the way
  - you need to have wood and gold production running as soon as possible - otherwise you can't make buildings and train citizens. Everything else can be fixed later.
  - usually, you need to take all the forests on your location
  - you need to make first farm close to storehouse, or else it will be late

# Basic rules for normal base
- first, focus on 5 stonemasons and 6 woodcutters. they are most important buildings! you can't make anything, if you don't have wood and stone...
- you need to make serfs and builders ALL THE TIME. Usually a base will work well with 22 builders and 75-80 serfs.
- make weapons, not food
- at first try to block everything in storehouse
- TODO ...

# Food
- swine farms are best buildings for food, because sausages are the most valuable food, and you get 
- Bakeries should only be used for
  - maps with low food
  - special strategies, where you do something else instead of leather army
- Vineyards should not be done before 50th minute. They waste wood, and wine is worse than sausages or even bread.

# advanced tips
- if your iron is far away (or you need to focus on something else), make iron mines, unlock iron ore in storehouse, then you can do other iron buildings much later
- consider making "early planting woodcutter" close to storehouse
